MSCI:3300 – Software Design and Development
Due Tuesday, February 3, 2015
Assignment:
Design a simple, two page web site about yourself. Use Git for version control of your application.
The purpose of this assignment is to help you become familiar with HTML tags and attributes, using external Cascading
Style Sheets, and coding to HTML5 and CSS3 standards. This assignment will also continue your introduction to Git
version control commands and workflow. It is meant to be a fun assignment that will also allow others in your group to
learn more about you. I will complete a HW2 as well so you can learn more about me. It will located at
https://instruct.biz.uiowa.edu/courses/msci3300/colbert/html/HW2
<p>Special Note:
Instruct is available to anyone in the world via a web browser (http://instruct.biz.uiowa.edu). Please keep this in mind
as you are deciding what information to share on the web pages. If you would prefer to not use your personal contact
information feel free to just use your name and / or email address.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>1) The web site should be created with a text editor such as Notepad++. Please do not use Dreamweaver, Visual Web
Developer, etc.</li>
<li>2) Files should reside in a HW2 folder on your Instruct. Your page should open automatically when I browse to your
HW2 folder.
i) Create two separate web pages in the root of your HW2 folder with hyperlinks to move back and forth
between the pages.
(a) index.html ‐ This is the first page users will see when they browse into your HW2 folder.
(b) resume.html ‐ This will be your online resume.
ii) Sub folders and file structure within the HW2 folder is your choice.</li>
<li>3) Include two appropriate photos of yourself appropriately tagged so tooltips will show in IE, Firefox and Chrome.</li>
<li>4) Include at least two different sizes of headings (i.e. (h1), (h2), etc.)</li>
<li>5) Include information in at least one HTML list.</li>
<li>6) resume.html should contain your resume with text left justified on a centered (div)</li>
<li>7) Use an external style sheet to apply formatting to at least six elements on your web site including background‐color.</li>
<li>8) Your style sheet should use at least 1 .css class for custom formatting.</li>
<li>9) Your style sheet makes use of a border and the box model for at least 1 element on your web site.</li>
<li>10) Create a second external style sheet for printing. Printing your resume.html page should be white background with
black text. Headings, bold, and italics are OK, but any pictures or color text/backgrounds should not be included in
the print version.</li>
<li>11) When viewed on the computer, resume.html should have styling similar to your index page. When printed, the print</li>
style sheet will be active and remove many of the formatting elements.</li>
<li>12) Appropriate use of heading tags, paragraph tags, and line breaks to organize information.</li>
<li>13) Site layout appears organized and easy to follow.</li>
<li>14) Site text is grammatically correct and spelled properly.</li>
<li>15) Pages pass successful validation as HTML5 and CSS3.
i) Run your pages through a validation program and fix any errors. I recommend doing this frequently, so you
know when something breaks.</li>
<li>16) You have multiple git commits and pushes with useful commit messages, including a final, to your GitHub repository.
You should also use at least one git branch and push the branch to your GitHub repository. Your branch should be
merged back into master. Your final commit should include a Git tag indicating this is the code for version 1 of your
web site.</li>
<li>17) I will view your pages on Instruct for grading.</li>
<li>18) I will view details of your HW2 repository on your GitHub account.</li>
